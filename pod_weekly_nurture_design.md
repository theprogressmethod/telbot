# Pod Weekly Nurture Sequence Design

## Design Philosophy & Decision Making Process

### Core Principles
1. **Weekly Rhythm Alignment** - Matches the natural pod meeting cycle
2. **Behavioral Psychology** - Uses optimal timing for habit formation
3. **Community First** - Strengthens pod bonds over individual achievement
4. **Progressive Momentum** - Builds from preparation to celebration
5. **Graceful Recovery** - Supports members through difficult weeks

### Design Decisions

**Why 7-Touch Weekly Sequence?**
- Research shows 7 touches create optimal engagement without overwhelm
- Aligns with natural weekly rhythms
- Covers all critical behavioral moments: prep, commitment, execution, accountability, reflection

**Why These Specific Timings?**
- **Monday morning** - Peak motivation and planning energy
- **Wednesday evening** - Mid-week check-in before meeting
- **Thursday** - Post-meeting momentum capture
- **Weekend** - Reflection and preparation for next week

**Why Pod-Focused vs Individual-Focused?**
- Pods are premium feature - messaging should reinforce value
- Community accountability is primary differentiator from free bot
- Pod bonds create stronger retention than individual habits
