Key issues:
-The crtical next step is 10x-100x development of the weekly nurture sequence for pod users. Not only should it be excellent at keeping users engaged, and creating a virtuous cycle that flows into the next week, the system should be highly visible/easy to understand/simple to control.
-Not enough people using the bot
-Bot UI: ratio of features to explanation/ processes for understanding how features are relevant and useful is too high
-Onboarding process to bot, pods, and The rogress MEthod in general is not optimized 
-Need to figure out where /feedback goes and create process to respond to it and act on it quickly
-Need better onboarding and explanation/demo for bot
-Need demo for future team members
-Need demo for potential investors
