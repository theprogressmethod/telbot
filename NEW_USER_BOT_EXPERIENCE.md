# New User Bot Experience - Progressive Command System

## Overview
The Telegram bot now implements a progressive command discovery system to avoid overwhelming new users while providing advanced functionality for experienced users.

## Command Visibility Progression

### Stage 1: First-Time Users
**Visible Commands:** `/start` only

**Behavior:**
- New users see only the `/start` command in their bot interface
- All other commands are hidden until the user completes onboarding
- The `/start` command initiates the user onboarding process

### Stage 2: Post-Onboarding Users  
**Visible Commands:** `/start`, `/commit`, `/done`, `/help`

**Behavior:**
- After successful completion of `/start` onboarding, users gain access to core functionality
- `/commit` - Create new commitments
- `/done` - Mark commitments as complete  
- `/help` - Show all available commands and explanations
- Advanced commands remain hidden until accessed via `/help`

### Stage 3: Full Access (via /help)
**All Commands Available:**
- `/start` - User onboarding and account setup
- `/commit` - Create new commitments
- `/done` - Mark commitments as complete
- `/list` - View all active commitments
- `/progress` - View progress statistics and streaks
- `/help` - Show this command list with explanations
- `/feedback` - Submit feedback about the system
- `/upgrade` - Access premium features and payment process

## Technical Implementation

### Command Visibility Control
Commands are controlled via the Telegram Bot API's `setMyCommands` endpoint with scope-specific command lists:

```python
# First-time users - only /start
basic_commands = [
    BotCommand(command="start", description="Begin your progress journey")
]

# Post-onboarding users - core commands
core_commands = [
    BotCommand(command="start", description="Account and onboarding"),
    BotCommand(command="commit", description="Create a new commitment"), 
    BotCommand(command="done", description="Mark commitment complete"),
    BotCommand(command="help", description="Show all commands")
]

# Full command set (revealed via /help)
all_commands = core_commands + [
    BotCommand(command="list", description="View active commitments"),
    BotCommand(command="progress", description="View progress stats"),
    BotCommand(command="feedback", description="Send feedback"),
    BotCommand(command="upgrade", description="Access premium features")
]
```

### User State Tracking
User progression is tracked in the database:
- `first_bot_interaction_at` - Timestamp of first `/start`
- `onboarded_at` - Completion of onboarding process
- `status` - User status (new, onboarded, paid, etc.)

## User Flow

### New User Journey
1. **Discovery**: User finds bot and sees only `/start` command
2. **Onboarding**: `/start` guides through account setup and goal setting
3. **Core Usage**: User gains access to `/commit`, `/done`, `/help`
4. **Feature Discovery**: `/help` reveals full command set
5. **Premium Upgrade**: `/upgrade` provides access to paid features

### Command Explanations (via /help)

**Essential Commands:**
- `/start` - Set up your account, define goals, and join the community
- `/commit` - Create a specific, actionable commitment with deadline
