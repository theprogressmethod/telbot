# Claude Orchestra Deployment System

## Overview
This system uses Claude's orchestration capabilities to create an intelligent, self-improving deployment pipeline that learns from each deployment cycle.

## Core Concept
Each deployment creates a "deployment memory" that Claude can reference in future deployments, making the process smarter and more efficient over time.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Dev → Staging Prep (Feature Selection)
- Claude analyzes all changes in dev
- Presents feature list with impact analysis
- Helps select what to ship
- Generates deployment documentation

### 2. Staging Prep → Staging (Testing)
- Automated test generation based on selected features
- Risk assessment
- Rollback plan preparation
- Performance impact analysis

### 3. Staging → Production (Deployment)
- Final safety checks
- Deployment execution
- Monitoring setup
- Success verification

### 4. Post-Deployment (Learning)
- Captures what worked/didn't work
- Updates deployment patterns
- Improves future predictions

## Getting Started

1. Initialize the orchestration system:
```bash
./orchestrate.sh init
```

2. Start a deployment:
```bash
./orchestrate.sh deploy
```

3. Claude will guide you through each stage interactively

## How It Gets Smarter

The system maintains a `deployment_memory/` directory with:
- Past deployment decisions
- Feature success rates
- Common issues and solutions
- Performance patterns
- User preferences

Each deployment adds to this knowledge base, making future deployments more intelligent.
